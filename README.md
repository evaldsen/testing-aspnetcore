# Testing ASP.NET Core

This is a sample repo where I collect tips and tricks for testing ASP.NET Core based applications.  
The primary focus is Web API returning JSON, but a lot of it should be usable for other scenarios as well. 
Things may be highly opinionated based on my experiences and may change over time. 

In additionl to Microsoft dependencies, this project depends on some external libraries.
